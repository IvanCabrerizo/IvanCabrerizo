üë®‚Äçüíª About Me
===============================
I'm an Android developer with 1 year and 8 months of experience, focused on building mobile applications using Kotlin and the Jetpack ecosystem. Lately, I've been working mainly with Jetpack Compose, exploring its declarative approach to creating modern, reactive user interfaces.

üì± I have a background in mobile development and hands-on experience with tools like Firebase, navigation, state management, architecture (MVVM), Room, and more.

üåê I also have basic knowledge of web development, Java, Python, MySQL, and C#, which allows me to adapt easily to different environments and technologies.

üá™üá¶¬† I'm based in Spain.

I'm always eager to learn and improve my skills by working on challenging projects that help me grow as a developer.
